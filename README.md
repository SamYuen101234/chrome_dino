# Reinforcement Learning of Chrome Dinosaur Running

The original source code of reinforcement learning chrome dinosaur running is from [DinoRunTutorial](https://github.com/Paperspace/DinoRunTutorial), which is a Kears version. If you want to know more details and explation of this mini project, you can visit RAVI MUNDE's blog [https://blog.paperspace.com/dino-run/](https://blog.paperspace.com/dino-run/). Thanks for his source code. I will make a pytorch version based on his source code and may do a little bit experiment on it. Also, I will explain some important points under this repository.
